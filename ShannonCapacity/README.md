## Talks

Shengfang Zheng will be responsible for the paper  [The zero error capacity of a noisy channel](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1056798), which is about some properties of the Shannon Capacity, and some motivation.

I will be responsible for the paper [The zero error capacity of a noisy channel](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1056798), which talks about more properties of the Shannon Capacity, and some way to compute it for special graphs.
