      \begin{itemize}
            \item We have proved that $Theta(C_{5}) = \sqrt{5}$
            \item We could actually proved that $\Theta(C_{n})$ is less or equal than $ n\frac{\cos(\pi/n)}{1+\cos(\pi/n)} $.
      \end{itemize}

      \frametitle{Open Questions}
      \begin{itemize}
            \item Although $\Theta(C_{n})$ is less or equal than $ n\frac{\cos(\pi/n)}{1+\cos(\pi/n)} $, but we still don't know the exact value of $\Theta(C_{n})$. Even for $n=7$
            \item Is there any good lower bound for $\Theta(C_{n})$?
            \item Is there any patterns for $n$ such that $\Theta(c_{n})$ is hard to compute? Such as, odd, or prime.
      \end{itemize}

      In the real world cases, we always have some kind of relay between the sender and receiver. So the new channel is kind of composite of two channel. Can we compute Shannon Capacity these channels independently and then combine them together to get the Shannon Capacity of the new Channel?
