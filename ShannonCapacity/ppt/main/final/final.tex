            Consider an umbrella that has a handle and $5$ ribs that all have unit length. And also its handle is a unit vector.  Also, angles between two consecutive ribs are same.

\begin{frame}
      \begin{proof}
            Let angle between $v_{1}, v_{3}$ and $v_{2}, v_{4}$ and $v_{3}, v_{5}$ and $v_{4}, v_{1}$ and $v_{5}, v_{2}$ be $\frac{\pi}{2}$.

            Then, the $5$ ribs of such an umbrella form an orthonormal representation of $C_{5}$.

            Let $d$ be the vector represent the handle, and $v_{1},v_{2},\dots,v_{5}$ be the $5$ ribs. And let $\gamma$ be the angle between the handle and any rib.

            So, by some calculation, we get
            \begin{eqnarray}
                  \theta(C_{5}) &=& \inf_{\{v_{1},v_{2} \hdots v_{5}\},c} \max_{i} \frac{1}{\langle c, v_{i} \rangle} \\
                  &\le& \max \frac{1}{<d,v_{i}>^{2}} \\
                  &=& \left(
                        \frac{1}{\cos(\gamma)}
                  \right)^{2} \\
                  &=& \sqrt{5}
            \end{eqnarray}
      \end{proof}
