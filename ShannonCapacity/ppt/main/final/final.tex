            Consider an umbrella that has a handle and $5$ ribs that all have unit length. And also its handle is a unit vector.

      \begin{proof}
            Here, angles between two consecutive ribs are same. 
            
            Let $v$ be a rib. And let $w$ be one of the rib that have the largest angle with $v$. Then, we let the angle between $v$ and $w$ be $ \pi/2 $.

            Then, the $5$ ribs of such an umbrella form an orthonormal representation of $C_{5}$.

            Let $d$ be the vector represent the handle, and $v_{1},v_{2},\dots,v_{5}$ be the $5$ ribs. And let $\gamma$ be the angle between the handle and any rib.

            So, by some calculation, we get
            \begin{eqnarray}
                  \theta(C_{5}) &\le& \max \frac{1}{<d,v_{i}>^{2}} \\
                  &=& \left(
                        \frac{1}{\cos(\gamma)}
                  \right)^{2} \\
                  &=& \sqrt{5}
            \end{eqnarray}
      \end{proof}
