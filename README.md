# Undergraduate Math Seminar

## Introduction

Undergraduate math seminar is a weekly event held by UNNC Math Department, at which there will be teachers and students introduce some interesting topic in math.

All topics are specially chosen, so that most students with basic knowledge of linear algebra and calculus could understand the topic. And all topics chosen by students will be supervised by staff of Math Department.

Also, most of the topics are chosen from [The American Mathematical Monthly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_American_Mathematical_Monthly), which is a journal intended for a wide audience of mathematicians, from undergraduate students to research professionals.
